# ESP32
ESP32 sensor data IoT

A project involving an ESP32 microcontroler with sensors (DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor) and others.
The objective of this IoT project is to send sensor data via ESP32 to a database on InfluxDB. This data is used and processed to a virtual environment for displaying. The chosen environment for the data visualisation from our sensors is Grafana.
